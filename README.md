this project is based on jupyter and machine learning 
we developed based on contentbased,collaborative and hybrid models 

to run program :
you need to install python and jupter 
and after dowload the xaamp
create singin and singup with a name ecom
and after install the required pips
and run program using 
py app.py

Here are the steps to install Python and Jupyter on your system:

 Step 1: Install Python

1. Download Python:
   - Go to the [Python official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   - Download the latest version suitable for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

2. Install Python:
   - Run the downloaded installer.
   - During installation, make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH" (especially on Windows).
   - Follow the installation prompts to complete the installation.

3. Verify Python Installation:
   - Open a terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on macOS/Linux).
   - Type `python --version` or `python3 --version` and press Enter.
   - You should see the installed Python version.

 Step 2: Install Jupyter Notebook

1. Install pip (Python package installer):
   - Pip usually comes with Python. If it’s not installed, you can install it using:
     ```bash
     python -m ensurepip --upgrade
     ```

2. Install Jupyter using pip:
   - In your terminal, type:
     ```bash
     pip install jupyter
     ```
   - If you are using Python 3, you may need to use `pip3 install jupyter`.

3. Verify Jupyter Installation:
   - After installation, you can check if Jupyter is installed by typing:
     ```bash
     jupyter --version
     ```

 Step 3: Launch Jupyter Notebook

1. Start Jupyter Notebook:
   - In your terminal, type:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook
     ```
   - This will start the Jupyter Notebook server and open the notebook interface in your default web browser.

2. Create and Run Notebooks:
   - You can create a new notebook by selecting "New" → "Python 3" in the Jupyter interface.
   - You can write and execute Python code in the cells of the notebook.

Let me know if you encounter any issues during the installation!
